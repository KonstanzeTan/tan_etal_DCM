## General 

This repository includes scripts for building CVD-trait specific Methylation Risk Scores (MRS) from CpGs in fine-mapped regions and analyzing their associations with the corresponding traits.

* `finemapped_cvd_MRS.R` :constructs CVD trait-specific MRS for a single fine-mapped region and tests its association with the respective CVD trait.
Weights for MRS construction were obtained from prior association tests between  individual CpG loci in a region and CVD traits.
