## General 
This repository contains scripts for identifying co-methylation modules from DCM-associated CpGs

## Construction of co-methylation modules (WGCNA)

* `wgcna_detect_consensus_modules_singleblock.R` : reads in ancestry-specific methylation data and specifies the parameters used to perform consensus network analysis using WGCNA. It identifies co-methylation moedules that are identified in common within ancestry-specific analysis
